# Interpolation and Correlation of Temperature - In Lower Austria and Vienna
Authors: Miriam Wolf, Frederic Tilmann, Christoph Haarich

### About

In this final project, different spatial analysis methods have been used to analyze if there are significant correlations between temperature and height and between temperature and urbanization degree. For that, a python script has been produced to run through the analysis. Also, a Web Map has been created to show the urbanization degree of each Gemeinde in Lower Austria and Vienna, and the measurement stations in the two previously mentioned federal states of Austria.
